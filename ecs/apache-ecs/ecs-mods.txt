In order to use NFS bind mount in the docker container, the NFS share has to be mounted
BEFORE the container run.
Reason: The bind mount is not working IF the NFS is not mounted before.

# Create folder on host:
mkdir /media/nfs

# Make static entry in fstab:

echo "<IP of proxy>:/share/uploads /media/nfs  nfs      defaults    0       0" >> /etc/fstab
